# problems-and-bookmarklets
a bunch of bookmarklets i've made in class. most of them make me question my sanity.
if you want to use them, just copy the entire thing into a bookmark in any web browser.
I'm guessing that some of these go over the character limit on some browsers, but that's your fault, not mine, that you didn't use Chrome.
